title:: @Outcome-Oriented Predictive Process Monitoring: Review and Benchmark

- [[Abstract]]
	- Predictive business process monitoring refers to the act of making predictions about the future state of ongoing cases of a business process, based on their incomplete execution traces and logs of historical (completed) traces. Motivated by the increasingly pervasive availability of ﬁne-grained event data about business process executions, the problem of predictive process monitoring has received substantial attention in the past years. In particular, a considerable number of methods have been put forward to address the problem of outcome-oriented predictive process monitoring, which refers to classifying each ongoing case of a process according to a given set of possible outcomes – e.g. Will the customer complain or not? Will an order be delivered, cancelled or withdrawn? Unfortunately, different authors have used different datasets, experimental settings, evaluation measures and baselines to assess their proposals, resulting in poor comparability and an unclear picture of the relative merits and applicability of different methods. To address this gap, this article presents a systematic review and taxonomy of outcome-oriented predictive process monitoring methods, and a comparative experimental evaluation of eleven representative methods using a benchmark covering twelve predictive process monitoring tasks based on four real-life event logs.

	- Business process monitoring is the act of analyzing events produced by a business process's execution at runtime to understand its performance and conformance to a set of business goals. #Introduction
