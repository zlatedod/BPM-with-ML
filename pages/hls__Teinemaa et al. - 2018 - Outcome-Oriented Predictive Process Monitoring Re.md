- Computation time. When assessing the performance of the methods, we distinguish the time taken in the ofﬂine and the online modes. The ofﬂine time is the total time needed to construct the classiﬁer from the historic traces available in an event log. Namely, it includes the time for constructing the preﬁx log, bucketing and encoding the preﬁx traces, and training the classiﬁer. In the online phase, it is essential that a prediction is produced almost instantaneously, as the predictions are usually needed in real time. Accordingly, we deﬁne the online time as the average t
